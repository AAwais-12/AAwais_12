👋 Hi, I'm Amaima Awais  (Professional Photo can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFdqe9NpTN_yCiKf9ysx7kf379uKcU0ItMe2scvE5d4/edit?tab=t.0)

🎓 Rising Junior at Brandeis University | Economics & International and Global Studies  
💼 AI/ML Fellow @ MIT x Break Through Tech | VP of Finance @ Brandeis Investment Club  
📈 Aspiring Quantitative Analyst | Passionate about Machine Learning + Markets

---

I'm deeply interested in how data and algorithms drive decision-making in finance. Through my coursework, leadership roles, and advanced machine learning fellowship at MIT x Break Through Tech, I’ve developed technical fluency in Python, Java, and statistical modeling—with an emphasis on real-world applications like fraud detection, operational optimization, and market analysis.

Currently, I’m enhancing my expertise in supervised/unsupervised learning, ensemble methods, and neural networks while applying financial reasoning through student-managed investment and treasury oversight roles.

💻 **Other Projects**

1. [MintCNN: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/AAwais-12/mint-cnn)

> Built a CNN from scratch to classify objects in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- Implemented using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`
- Designed and tuned deep learning architecture: convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers
- Achieved strong test accuracy and visualized performance with a confusion matrix

**Tech:** `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`  
**ML Concepts:** CNNs, activation functions, overfitting, model evaluation


- 2. Ensemble Regression Methods (https://github.com/AAwais-12/Ensemble-Regression-Models)

> Compares the performance of individual and ensemble regression models using a real-world dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Preprocessed structured tabular data for regression modeling
- Tuned and evaluated models using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Demonstrated the superior performance of ensemble models through comparative analysis
- Visualized results with scatter plots, residual error plots, and performance bar charts

Tools & Techniques:
Python · scikit-learn · pandas · seaborn · Jupyter Notebook · Regression Modeling · Ensemble Learning · Data Visualization

Impact:
Achieved highest accuracy using a Stacking Regressor (R² ≈ 0.83), demonstrating the practical advantage of ensemble methods in structured prediction tasks
