I'm deeply interested in how data and algorithms drive decision-making in finance. Through my coursework, leadership roles, and advanced machine learning fellowship at MIT x Break Through Tech, I’ve developed technical fluency in Python, Java, and statistical modeling—with an emphasis on real-world applications like fraud detection, operational optimization, and market analysis.

Currently, I’m enhancing my expertise in supervised/unsupervised learning, ensemble methods, and neural networks while applying financial reasoning through student-managed investment and treasury oversight roles.
