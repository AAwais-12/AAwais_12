## About Me  
I'm a curious and driven student passionate about using technology to solve complex problems, especially in finance and global systems. As an MIT Break Through Tech AI Fellow, I've built projects in deep learning, predictive modeling, and time-series forecasting. I’m particularly excited about the intersection of data science, economics, and equity.
